            <p>
                Full stack web developer who is results driven and excited by creating technological solutions.
                Helping refine business requirements to identify any underlying problems and keep focus on development
                goals.
                With my development background I am able to better understand data flows and technical challenges to
                create implementation
                strategies. Within development I find enjoyment out of creating positive user experiences for customers
                and developing out
                of the box solutions to aid them. My past experiences have ranged from command line server application
                to single page web
                applications. Regardless of language or environment I enjoy creating the most appropriate solution for
                the problem at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of professional development I love researching solutions to problems in my day to day life.
                This website will show off some of the virtual and non virtual projects I have been working on.
                On the virtual side I have enjoyed creating AutoHotKey scripts for games and programs to help me create
                prototypes for my
                board game. In the real world I enjoy working on automobiles and projects on my house. Overall I like to
                keep myself busy
                and am always finding something to tinker with.
            </p>

                <div class="text-center">
                    <p> This board game came from my experience playing table top RPGs, online games, and deck
                        building games.
                        My goal was to create a party building adventure game that could encapsulate tactical combat and
                        character progression.
                        The combat is a turn based initiative system providing the player with actions to
                        attack,
                        use items, or move to different combat zones.
                        Initiative values will determine the order characters can attack others and when they will be
                        attacked by others.
                        Players will be able to create decks from cards of their choice that will be used to
                        determine their enemies, rewards and other in game experiences.

                    <h1>Fountain of Eternity:</h1>
                    <p>Eternity creates Eternal and Finite planes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Creation of Gods:</h1>
                    <p>Eternity creates the Gods to manage the Finite plane. These Gods symbolize the power holding the
                        Finite plane together: The Planes, Time, Death, Life, and Ethereal.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Summoning of Greater Beings:</h1>
                    <p>The Gods soon combat the superiority of their power in the Finite plane and populate the plane
                        with
                        their respective power to increase their strength in the Eternal plane. So as to not endanger
                        themselves in combat, these Greater Beings are trained to champion them; Chaos is introduced
                        alongside.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Calling of the Beasts:</h1>
                    <p>Eternity worries of Chaos and creates beasts within the Finite plane to equalize the power in the
                        Gods. These beasts are designed for all realms and powers of the Finite plane; as the combat
                        rages
                        on, only the strongest beasts are able to fight off the impending Chaos.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Controlling of the Lesser Beings:</h1>
                    <p>These Greater Beings have been combating Beasts for eons with no ending in sight. The Gods, still
                        desperate for power, inflict their powers upon beasts directly. These influences alongside Chaos
                        lead them to form hoards of Lesser Beings commanded by the Greaters. As entropy increases in the
                        Finite plane, the God of Chaos increases in strength, introducing unexpected results for the
                        Gods.

                    <br>
                    <h1>Standoff of the Gods:</h1>
                    <p>The Lord of the Finite Plane revels in death and desires to slay all Beings but is no match for
                        the
                        extent the other Gods have become. The Ethereal Queen’s reservoir of power is tapping dry and is
                        unable to drain that of her enemies. The Plane Eater attempts to destroy the plane but fails as
                        Chaos in the plane is too unstable and would damage the Eternal plane. The Great Dragon protects
                        his
                        stake by pausing his reality from within the Eternal plane hoping to outlast the increasing
                        Chaos.
                        The Deathshifter gathers his power by giving life to the dead in order to be the last God
                        standing.
                        As the balance that was created to keep control reaches maximum Chaos, the dawn of a new light
                        emerges.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>The Nursing of Man:</h1>
                    <p>With the Gods now factioned and fighting between themselves, Eternity creates another creature to
                        ultimately combat the increasing Chaos. Man is created with powers of all Gods to force Beings
                        to
                        the fringes of the Finite plane, ultimately breaking the standoff of power. Eternity gave Man a
                        level of creativity, drive, and willpower to overcome the Chaos developed by the feud of the
                        Gods.
                        Where the Gods have no choice in wanting power, Man has the power of wanting choice. Man,
                        Eternity’s
                        reaper on the power of the Gods.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>The Castout:</h1>
                    <p>Man with choice, soon banded together to drive off droves of Beasts and Beings to find residence
                        within the Finite plane. While accomplishing this, Man learned of Eternity’s plan and was able
                        to
                        rationalize their own decision for conquering the Chaos of the Finite planes and Eternity. As
                        Eternity's grip to regain all that he has made slipped, he forces the hand of the Gods to
                        eliminate
                        Man.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h1>War for Dominion:</h1>
                    <p>Man free of the guidance of Eternity turned to cleansing the Finite plane of all creatures of
                        Eternity. The Gods have retreated to “TOWN NAME”, the last known portal between the Finite and
                        Eternal plane. Man is on the final push to cleanse the Finite. When man turned its back on
                        Eternity,
                        Eternity focused on Man, forcing a war for the Finite plane, a war for Fate. What Chaos is
                        waiting
                        to unfold?</p>

                <h3 class="heading-modal">IOU RPG Script</h3>
                <p>I created various files using Java, Excel and AutoHotKey to create scripts to do tasks within the
                    game. To accomplish this I used AutoHotKey to find pixel positions/colors of all points of
                    interactions within
                    the game. After storing these all into an excel file I wrote a Java script to parse the file and
                    depending
                    on the presence of a pixel color, write to a file containing AutoHotKey functions. With the
                    resulting
                    files I could easily copy comma\\nds in desired order to a new AutoHotKey script to build
                    complex actions.</p>

                <p>For me specifically this allowed me to play 6 accounts at once and with binded keystrokes execute
                    diverse
                    tasks across all accounts. Using functionally of AutoHotKey I was able to write conditions to
                    track windows
                    open and start an early state identification within the game itself.</p>

                <p>IdleFunctionsIndividual.ahk contains individual lines for each function. Using this in
                    combination with one
                    another will build complex tasks to be performed by AutoHotKey.</p>

                <p>IdleFunctions_Java.ahk contains the actual functions, these functions need to be present in your
                    FINAL .ahk
                    file to be ran. The commands from the previous file can be copied within this file for specific
                    bindings
                    to create your own custom scripts.</p>

                <p>IdleFunctions.ahk is a file I have started to construct and test various tasks. Online 2957 you
                    will notice
                    a command HoldEnter, this takes a number of times 'enter' will be held pressed as input. This
                    can be
                    used for Mining and Woodcutting with ease. Line 2972 is what I personally used to switch between
                    my different
                    browsers/windows. This configuration is designed with 1080 resolution, first 10 windows being
                    the game,
                    and one unopened quick launch preceding.</p>

                <p>The input parameters x and y are the pixel coordinates of the top left corner of the game in your
                    browser at
                    100% zoom.</p>
                <p>Speed will determine the time between each click, this can be easily adjusted for your lag and
                    ping.
                <p>Pixel will be defined by the line of code above the command, this will be predetermined from the
                    excel
                    file. The function will check the color for position passed in and compared to what it should
                    be.</p>
                <p>Functions with the menu parameter are my work in progress; these accept a "true" assuming the
                    menu is
                    present and checks if there is or isn't based on various pixel locations unique to it.</p>
                <p>My current main task is on line 2747, here you can see my declare my speed, x, y and set my
                    CoordMode.
                    It currently loops through each window and uses GAME_CHECK to see if the menu is on menu
                    selection
                    or wave change, then changes to menu selection. </p>
                <p>Please be aware to add esc::ExitApp to the end of your script. </p>

                <img src="images/boardgame/card_to_pdf_1.png" alt="images" class="modal-image" />
                <div class='text-center'>

                    <p>I started development of this application to aide in the creation of the playing cards for my
                        board game. I was spending large amounts of time placing images in pixel perfect locations to
                        have them easily printed and cut to size. This got even more difficult to align the front and
                        back images of the card. This application allows me to select a directory to find images, select
                        combinatons of front and rear images, define a quantity, and then generate a PDF ready for
                        printing and cutting.
                    </p>
                    <p>After selecting a directory you will have the option to provide additional search terms for the
                        file name and type. This allows a user to search for specific terms such as 'gold' or 'realase'
                        of type .png to quickly and easily create a new gold deck.</p>

                    <p> </p>
                    <p>In the main imageview sections, front and rear images can be selected and added to a deck list
                        via the "Add to
                        list" button. Front images can then be selected to go to a 'used' group which will remove them
                        from the main search group. Current revision only allows for Poker sized cards, 63mmx88mm.
                    </p>
                    <p>The buttons below the deck information will allow the user to clear the deck, remove cards, or
                        update the quantity of a card selected. </p>
                    <p>When a constructed deck is ready to be generated, the options at the bottom allow the user to
                        select DPI, PDF page size, and the bleed edge. Bleed will be the distance in mm from the edge of
                        the image to another.
                    </p>
                    <p>A destination folder and file name can be selected or your desktop and current time will be used
                        as the file name default.
                        The check box will automatically launch the PDF in your current default application
                        for quick preview.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most of the development has been designed to my specific needs and with lots of conditions and
                        cornor cases that have not been addressed. Any thoughts or ideas are welcome
                        to submission on the projects Github.

                <div class="text-center">
                    <p>Development of this applications stemmed from the creation of PDF Card Generator. I realized if a
                        card had an incorrect value it was labor intensive to update the text values on the image file.
                        Instead of having multiple versions of card images with different text values, it would be
                        easier to write an appliction to populate the text values dynamically onto a card template. </p>
                    <p>This program leverages using CSV files for a data source of text values, templates of the
                        different
                        types of cards, and any supporting images required. The program currently has global coordinates
                        defined in the code for text locations, in the future I would prefer them to be defined outside
                        the
                        application with the text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Depending on the length of text the application can determine if it needs to increase or
                        decrease
                        the font size to fit. In certain text fields the application is able to handle run off words and
                        return the text to a new line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application takes in a directory of templates and provides an imageview for visual
                        selecting.
                        You then need to tell the application which template to use for internally defined coordinates.
                        The
                        user then is required to select the CSV file and directory to be used for images.
                    </p>
                    <p> Overall this application has been an amazing time saver to help me recreate cards and fix all my
                        typos on my first prototype run! </p>

                <img src="images/sifter/sifter_2.jpg" alt="images" height="506" width="858" />
                <p>
                    This project stemmed from the dislike of using traditional clay based cat litter; the dust after
                    after cleaning, refined powder on the ground over time and
                    the volume of waste it produced. Researching led me to find pine pellets which alleviated the
                    dislikes of clay litter. There is little to no tracking from the box,
                    no dust is stirred up in the air, and the used litter is easier to dispose of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After initial use I discovered that the method of sifting used for other traditional litters
                    would not work effectively for pine pellets. In a traditional sense the
                    material traveling through the sifter would be retained, with pine pellets that material becomes
                    disposed. This is due yo the pine pellets breaking down into fines
                    when they come into contact with a liquid. Finding an efficient method to remove the fines is
                    the goal to help promote the use of pine pellet litters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my first attempt I sought out two storage containers that would leave volume between them
                    when stacked. This volume would allow room for the fines to collect while
                    sifting. To create holes for the sifting container I used a drill bit with a smaller diameter
                    than the pellets and attempted to put holes as close together as possible.
                    I was unable to create as tight of a pattern as I would like due to the plastic fracturing. I
                    created a cut out on the side in hopes the cats would use the whole set up
                    as a litter box but they were not fond of getting inside of it. One concern to be addressed is
                    how much weight can the sifting container hold with more holes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my second attempt I wanted to address if I could create a more efficient sifting pattern.
                    One of the findings from my first attempt was that many fines would sit between
                    holes and with side to side shaking pile up on the edges. For this I decided to put holes on the
                    side going up about an inch. To create a tighter hole pattern I decided to
                    make a template with a thin piece of metal that I could then use a soldering iron to puncture
                    holes without fracturing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am still in the process of creating all the holes, this turned out to be a much longer process
                    than I anticipated. The melting plastic is not desirable and very hard to work around.
                    If i can prove a tighter pattern to be significantly better I will search out methods of CNC
                    cutting to focus on structural strength.
